# # Rabbits and foxes
# 
# There are initially 400 rabbits and 200 foxes on a farm (but it could be two cell types in a 96 well plate or something, if you prefer bio-engineering analogies). Plot the concentration of foxes and rabbits as a function of time for a period of up to 600 days. The predator-prey relationships are given by the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations:
# 
# \begin{align}
# \frac{dR}{dt} &= k_1 R - k_2 R F \tag{1}\\
# \frac{dF}{dt} &= k_3 R F - k_4 F \tag{2}\\
# \end{align}
# 
# * Constant for growth of rabbits $k_1 = 0.015$ day<sup>-1</sup>
# * Constant for death of rabbits being eaten by foxes $k_2 = 0.00004$ day<sup>-1</sup> foxes<sup>-1</sup>
# * Constant for growth of foxes after eating rabbits $k_3 = 0.0004$ day<sup>-1</sup> rabbits<sup>-1</sup>
# * Constant for death of foxes $k_4 = 0.04$ day<sup>-1</sup>
# 
# Also plot the number of foxes versus the number of rabbits.
# 
# Then try also with 
# * $k_3 = 0.00004$ day<sup>-1</sup> rabbits<sup>-1</sup>
# * $t_{final} = 800$ days
# 
# *This problem is based on one from Chapter 1 of H. Scott Fogler's textbook "Essentials of Chemical Reaction Engineering".*

# Let's step back for a moment. Suppose we have a first-order ODE $u'=f(u)$. You know that if we were to integrate this, there would be an arbitrary constant of integration. To find its value, we do need to know one point on the curve $(t, u)$. When the derivative in the ODE is with respect to time, we call that point the _initial value_ and write something like this:
# 
# $$u(t=0)=u_0$$
# 
# In the case of a second-order ODE, we can write it as a system of first-order ODEs, and we would need an initial value for each equation: two conditions are needed to determine our constants of integration. **Check that you understand how to do this!** The same applies for higher-order ODEs: if it is of order $n$, we can write it as $n$ first-order equations, and we need $n$ known values. If we have that data, we call the problem an _initial value problem_.
# 
# Remember the definition of a derivative? The derivative represents the slope of the tangent at a point of the curve $u=u(t)$, and the definition of the derivative $u'$ for a function is:
# 
# $$u'(t) = \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \frac{u(t+\Delta t)-u(t)}{\Delta t}$$
# 
# If the step $\Delta t$ is already very small, we can _approximate_ the derivative by dropping the limit. We can write:
# 
# $$\begin{equation}
# u(t+\Delta t) \approx u(t) + u'(t) \Delta t
# \end{equation}$$
# 
# With this equation, and because we know $u'(t)=f(u)$, if we have an initial value, we can step by $\Delta t$ and find the value of $u(t+\Delta t)$, then we can take this value, and find $u(t+2\Delta t)$, and so on: we say that we _step in time_, numerically finding the solution $u(t)$ for a range of values: $t_1, t_2, t_3 \cdots$, each separated by $\Delta t$. The numerical solution of the ODE is simply the table of values $t_i, u_i$ that results from this process.
# 

# # Euler's method
# *Also known as "Simple Euler" or sometimes "Simple Error".*
# 
# The approximate solution at time $t_n$ is $u_n$, and the numerical solution of the differential equation consists of computing a sequence of approximate solutions by the following formula, based on this equation:
# 
# $$u_{n+1} = u_n + \Delta t \,f(u_n).$$
# 
# This formula is called **Euler's method**.
# 
# For the equations of the rabbits and foxes, Euler's method gives the following algorithm that we need to implement in code:
# 
# \begin{align}
# R_{n+1} & = R_n + \Delta t \left(k_1 R_n - k_2 R_n F_n \right) \\
# F_{n+1} & = F_n + \Delta t \left( k_3 R_n F_n - k_4 F_n \right).
# \end{align}

    foxes[n+1] = foxes[n] + delta_t * (k3 * rabbits[n] * foxes[n]
                                      - k4 * foxes[n])


# Now let's plot the results.

# In[3]:

plt.plot(times, rabbits, label='rabbits')
plt.plot(times, foxes, label='foxes')
plt.legend(loc='best') # put the legend somewhere it doesn't overlap things
plt.show()


# Now let's copy and paste the code above, and turn it into a function so we can evaluate it with many different step sizes. In order to compare the different results we need to pick some quantity of interest (QOI). We'll choose the maximum number of foxes, because it's simple to find and presumably interesting, although if you care more about the time at which the maximum occurs, or the number of rabbits, or something else, then use that instead.

# Smaller step sizes give more accurate results, and we see it converges towards the "true" solution as we go left on the graph.

The slope should give us the order of convergence of the method.

# The straight line slope of 1 shows that Simple Euler is a first order algorithm. 
# We only get below an error of $10^0$ (1.0) in this quantity of interest with the second smallest step size, $\sim$0.002.
# The Euler method is not very good - it requires tiny steps and converges slowly. 

# # Homework
# 
# ## 1. Runke-Kutta (RK4)
# Implement the [Ruge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungeâ€“Kutta_methods) RK4 method.
# First set up the right hand side of the ODE as a function, because you'll need to call it repeatedly within a single iteration.
# Determine the order of convergence (plot a `loglog` plot of *error* vs. $\Delta t$ like above)

# ## 2. Batteries included!
# Let's solve this with an even better ODE integrator. One that we don't have to write!
# Use `odeint` from the `scipy.integrate` package. Check its documentation (online) for details.
